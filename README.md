# Behavioral Cloning Project

In this project, I use a neural network to clone car driving behavior. It is a supervised regression problem between the car steering angles and the road images in front of a car.  
## Project Description
### The goals / steps of this project are the following:
- Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
- Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
- Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
- Summarize the results with a written report  
### Files included
`model.py` : The script used to create and train the model  
`drive.py` : The script to drive the car in autonomous mode  
`model.h5` : The script to provide useful functionalities (i.e. image preprocessing and augumentation)  
`writeup_report.md` : Summarize the results   
### Getting started
Additionally you need to download and unpack the [Udacity self-driving car simulator (Version 2)](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim).    
### Run the pretrained model
To run the code start the simulator in `autonomous mode`, Then, run the model as follows:  
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

### To train the model
first make a directory ./data/, drive the car in training mode around the track and save the data to this directory.   
Then, run the model as follows:
```sh
python model.py
```
## Model Architecture and Training Strategy
### Model architecture
I used the NVIDIA's CNN model introduced in the Udacity lesson.

### Data Preprocessing

First, read images and steering angles, which are the dataset provided from Udacity, from the csv file <model.py line:10-26>. Then converted the color space from BGR into RGB for drive.py, cropped top 55[pixel] and bottom 20[pixel] (i.e. 160x320x3 ---> 85x320x3), and resized to 68x204 (i.e. 85x320x3 ---> 68x204x3) in order to feed to the NVIDIA's CNN architecture <model.py line:27-33>.


### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py
* writeup_template.md

The simulator can be downloaded from the classroom. In the classroom, we have also provided sample data that you can optionally use to help train your model.

## Details About Files In This Directory

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1
...
```

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.

#### Why create a video

1. It's been noted the simulator might perform differently based on the hardware. So if your model drives succesfully on your machine it might not on another machine (your reviewer). Saving a video is a solid backup in case this happens.
2. You could slightly alter the code in `drive.py` and/or `video.py` to create a video of what your model sees after the image is processed (may be helpful for debugging).

### Tips
- Please keep in mind that training images are loaded in BGR colorspace using cv2 while drive.py load images in RGB to predict the steering angles.
